# Green Spaces and Tree Map Visualization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data about urban trees in the city of Grenoble. The dataset contains rich information such as tree locations (latitude and longitude), height, age, species, and health conditions. The end goal is to create a web application that provides an interactive map to display trees and their associated data, along with predictive analytics for maintenance and sustainability planning.

## Objectives

1. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
   - Explore the attributes to uncover patterns and relationships.

2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Implement predictive models to:
     - Identify potential defects in trees.
     - Classify defect locations (roots, trunk, crown, etc.).
   - Evaluate and refine models for optimal accuracy and recall.

3. **Web Application**:
   - Build a website that:
     - Displays an interactive map of trees with detailed parameters.
     - Allows users to explore data about individual trees.
     - Integrates insights from the machine learning models.

4. **Sustainability Insights**:
   - Analyze the dataset to offer recommendations for better tree management.
   - Provide tools for urban planners and botanists to make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following:
- **Tree Attributes**: Type, developmental stage, height, age, and species.
- **Location**: Latitude and longitude of trees in Grenoble.
- **Health Information**: Diagnostics and treatment recommendations.
- **Environmental Context**: Surroundings and maintenance data.

The data is sourced from municipal services and is part of the FDEC challenge for sustainable development.

## Tasks

### Challenge 1: Tree Defect Prediction
- **Task 1**: Single-label classification to predict if a tree has a defect.
- **Task 2**: Multi-label classification to predict the location(s) of defects.

### Challenge 2: Visualizing and Analyzing Urban Trees
- Develop tools and insights for understanding the state and evolution of Grenoble's "tree park."
- Use visualizations and external data to support findings and recommendations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Web Development**: Flask/Streamlit, Leaflet.js for map rendering
